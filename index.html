                    <img class="left-float-image" src="./images/content/andrew_2013.jpg">
                    <p>Andrew Moody grew up in Blackstone, VA and graduated from Virginia Tech in 2005 with a degree in Property Management and minors in Real Estate and Business.  After working for a property management firm in Harrisonburg, VA, managing a multi-million dollar portfolio of residential and commercial properties and homeowners' and condo associations for five years, Andrew and his wife [Kim Parrish Moody] moved to Orange, VA. Andrew then worked in the accounting department of his family's business in Culpeper.  Andrew has also served as an officer for the <a href="http://www.alumni.vt.edu/" target="_blank" class="main_links">Virginia Tech Alumni Association</a> in each community that he has lived in.  In 2010 Andrew and Kim moved back to Nottoway County to be closer to family.  During that time Andrew opened Stewardship Solutions and got back to his other passion, selling real estate, for <a href="http://www.accessrealtyva.com/" target="_blank" class="main_links">Access Realty</a>. His wife complements him very well with her own company, <a href="http://www.kimmoodydesign.com/" target="_blank" class="main_links">Kim Moody Design, LLC</a>.  KMD does home staging as well as event planning and interior design! Andrew and Kim also own a retail store, <a href="http://trendva.com/" target="_blank" class="main_links">trend.</a>, that sells a variety of gift items with a focus on Virginia-made products and monogramming on site. In the little bit of free time that Andrew and Kim have, they enjoy spending it with family.
