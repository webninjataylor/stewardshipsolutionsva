				<h2>About the Company</h2>
				<img class="left-float-image" src="./images/content/andrew_2013.jpg" />
				<p>Andrew Moody grew up in Blackstone, VA and graduated from Virginia Tech in 2005 with a degree in Property Management and minors in Real 
				Estate and Business.  After working for a property management firm in Harrisonburg, VA, managing a multi-million dollar portfolio of 
				residential and commercial properties and homeowners' and condo associations for five years, Andrew and his wife [Kim Parrish Moody] moved to 
				Orange, VA. Andrew then worked in the accounting department of his family's business in Culpeper.  Andrew has also served as an officer for 
				the <span class="main_links"><a href="http://www.alumni.vt.edu/" target="_blank">Virginia Tech Alumni Association</a></span> in each 
				community that he has lived in.  In 2010 Andrew and Kim moved back to Nottoway County to be closer to family.  During that time Andrew opened Stewardship Solutions and got back to his other passion, selling real estate, for <span class="main_links"><a href="http://www.accessrealtyva.com/" target="_blank">Access Realty</a></span>. His wife complements him very well with her own company, <span class="main_links"><a href="http://www.kimmoodydesign.com/" target="_blank">Kim Moody Design, LLC</a></span>.  KMD does home staging as well as event planning and interior design! In the little bit of free time that Andrew and Kim have, they enjoy spending it with family.
